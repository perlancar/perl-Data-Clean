0.502   2018-10-14  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Revert the decision to use Sereal::Dclone because of problem with
	  cloning coderefs, defaults to Clone::PP for now.

	- No functional changes.

	- [doc] Document that module specified in !clone_func will
	  automatically be loaded.


0.500   2018-10-09  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Replace Data::Clone with Sereal::Dclone because the former cannot
	  handle JSON::PP::Boolean object (reported since Jan 2013, but no
	  fix released yet; ref:
	  https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=82584).


0.49    2017-07-10  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- No functional changes.

	- Replace Log::Any with Log::ger.


0.48    2017-01-14  Released-By: PERLANCAR

0.47    2017-01-14  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [Internal] [Incompatible change] Put compiled code in
	  $self->{_code} instead of $self->{code}, put compilation data
	  result in $self->{_cd}.


0.46    2017-01-14  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [Internal] [Incompatible change] _generate_cleanser_code() now returns
	  compilation data containing source code as well as required modules,
	  etc. This gives more useful information for code generators e.g.
	  Perinci::CmdLine::Inline.

	- [Incompatible change] command_* methods now take $cd (compilation data
	  structure) as the first argument to ease passing data between routines
	  during generation of cleanser code.

        - Remove use of Acme::Damn to simplify things. Acme::Damn modifies the
	  original object while Data::Clone does not clone objects, so we needed
	  to differentiate case of clone_and_clean vs clean_in_place. In the
	  case of clone_and_clean() we also need to make sure we don't use
	  Acme::Damn to avoid modifying the original object. We now always
	  shallow clone object to unbless it, so we don't need this case
	  differentiation.

        - [Removed features] Remove commands: unbless_pp, unbless_ffc_inlined.
          UPDATE 2019-09-08: command unbless_ffc_inline re-added, we need this
          to build Data-Clean-ForJSON-Pregen.


0.45    2017-01-10  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Remove embedding of String::LineNumber & String::PerlQuote (I
	  don't feel embedding is elegant or worth the hassle, we should
	  fatpack/datapack only the scripts).


0.44    2017-01-03  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Add option: !clone_func.

	- Add command: unbless_ffc_inlined. UPDATE 2017-01-14: now removed.
