0.47    2017-01-14 (PERLANCAR)

	- [Internal] [Incompatible change] Put compiled code in
	  $self->{_code} instead of $self->{code}, put compilation data
	  result in $self->{_cd}.


0.46    2017-01-14 (PERLANCAR)

	- [Internal] [Incompatible change] _generate_cleanser_code() now returns
	  compilation data containing source code as well as required modules,
	  etc. This gives more useful information for code generators e.g.
	  Perinci::CmdLine::Inline.

	- [Incompatible change] command_* methods now take $cd (compilation data
	  structure) as the first argument to ease passing data between routines
	  during generation of cleanser code.

        - Remove use of Acme::Damn to simplify things. Acme::Damn modifies the
	  original object while Data::Clone does not clone objects, so we needed
	  to differentiate case of clone_and_clean vs clean_in_place. In the
	  case of clone_and_clean() we also need to make sure we don't use
	  Acme::Damn to avoid modifying the original object. We now always
	  shallow clone object to unbless it, so we don't need this case
	  differentiation.


0.45    2017-01-10 (PERLANCAR)

	- Remove embedding of String::LineNumber & String::PerlQuote (I
	  don't feel embedding is elegant or worth the hassle, we should
	  fatpack/datapack only the scripts).


0.44    2017-01-03 (PERLANCAR)

	- Add option: !clone_func.

	- Add command: unbless_ffc_inlined.

0.40    2016-12-27 (PERLANCAR)

	- No functional changes.

	- Standardize header & footer comment for embedded modules.


0.39    2016-12-27 (PERLANCAR)

	- No functional changes.

	- Replace embedding code with fatpack code so it can be loaded on
	  demand.


0.38    2016-12-26 (PERLANCAR)

	- Downgrade String::LineNumber and String::PerlQuote from
	  RuntimeRequires to RuntimeSuggests, embed these modules.


0.37    2016-05-31 (PERLANCAR)

        - Replace circular test with another one which is not failing [CT].


0.36    2016-05-28 (PERLANCAR)

        - [Bugfix] Fix deep recursion problem by detecting circular reference
          early, before other options.


0.35    2016-05-21 (PERLANCAR)

        - [Bugfix] Recursing into object should be done after processing object
          of specific class and -object (any object).

        - [Bugfix] A couple more bug fixes.


0.34    2016-05-21 (PERLANCAR)

	- No functional changes.

	- [Bugfix][doc] Fix wrong documentation: !recurse_object should
	  have been !recurse_obj.

	- First release, renamed from Data::Clean::Base and separated to its own
          dist.
